## **Making a case for the MUV proximity sensor:**




**Proximity sensor, PCB + Components Dimensions:**

Screw holes: 51.5mm x 38.75mm

H: 70mm

W: 59mm x 59mm

**Proximity Sensor Case, Key points for design:**

-Allow NFC to function

-Design for manufacture with Fablab machines

-Ease of assembly

-Access to all buttons and USB port

-Access to battery

-B,C and Tag LEDs all visible

**Research and Preparation:**

I chose 4mm poplar triplex as a material for the proximity sensor as I think it well suited to the intended application of the proximity sensor; they will be indoors and there will be many of them. The 4mm poplar triplex is a good value for its level of durability.

I did tests to find the right sizing and settings for making press fit components on our lasercutter. After some time I descided that Speed 100 and Power 100 gave a good balance between keeping corners sharp and minimizing burning. It also has the added benefit of cutting quickly.

Next I had to find out the kerf of my lasercutter with this material at these settings. Cutting the slots of my press fit joints to 3.7mm gave a good fit with the 4mm triplex I have decided to use for the proximity sensor case.

Here's a guide on how to figure out the kerf of your lasercutter:

All of the designs here were made with the .15 (each side) kerf of my lasercutter, you will have to adjust the sizing of the joints for the characteristics of your lasercutter.

## **Designing & Making:**




**Designing:**

**INSERT IMAGE "Sketch"**

If I make the box with press-fit finger joints on all sides, then the enclosures can be stacked in the x and y axis, providing opportunity for expansions to the proximity sensor in the future.

For this project, I think its the most time effective to use an online lasercut box generator.

A quick google search gave me some online options for designing lasercut joints. I liked "makercase.com" because of its  simplicity and visual preview.

**INSERT IMAGE "Makercase"**

I used makercase to quickly design the joints of the box. The website allows you to enter the kerf of your lasecutter and adjusts the files it outputs to press fit together nicely.

I then edited the parts in illustrator to make the width of the joints the same along the whole length of all sides of the case.(makercase.com makes the first and last joints larger, I don't want this)  This will allow the boxes to be stacked together as per my design. 

I cut out small sections of each part to check the fit without wasting much material: 

**INSERT IMAGE "Tests"**

After I had the basic box shape, I measured and mapped out the required holes for the buttons and LEDs to be usable/ visable, again testing as I went.

Here is the plans for the final design of my case for the MUV proximity sensor:

**INSERT IMAGE "Plans"**

Each part of the design can be cut halfway and the joint pattern can be extended to make any height or width box.



**Materials Needed:**

4mm triplex poplar (300mm x 320mm)

Small pieces of frosted acrylic to act as diffusers for the LEDs ( can be cut from scrap)

Small piece of double sided tape

2x m2.6 x 20 screws and nuts

4x m2.6 x 7.5 screws and nuts

Sandpaper, CA glue and rubber hammer (if needed to help with assembly)
